	// 
	// The intended use for this and the other blacklist is to work around edge-cases caused by other mods, that result in missing-texture trims.
	// For example, combining newer elytra trims versions with an older version of this mod, results in frequent missing-texture trims.
	// This and the other blacklist allows blacklisting all the problematic materials/patterns in order to get rid of the missing-texture trims.
	// However, please also report the edge-cases, causing the missing-texture trims, to the mods issue tracker,
	// so that the edge-cases can potentially be fixed directly inside this mod and can be fixed it for once and for all/for all users.
	// 
	// This uses regex, allowing for more advanced configuration.
	// To ease the configuration of the blacklist, theres a util tab inside the config screen, which contains a button to validate the blacklist.
	// 
	// Example configuration, blacklisting the amethyst and all of biomes_o_plenty's materials:
	// material_blacklist: ["minecraft:amethyst", "biomes_o_plenty:"],
	material_blacklist: [],
	// Blacklist for trim patterns.
	// 
	// Read material_blacklist's comment for more context and information.
	// 
	// Example configuration, blacklisting the wild trim pattern and all of more_armor_trims's patterns:
	// patterns_blacklist: ["minecraft:wild", "more_armor_trims:"],
	pattern_blacklist: [
		"tooltrims"
